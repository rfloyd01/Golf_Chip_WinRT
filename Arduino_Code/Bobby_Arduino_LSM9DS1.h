     * Some notes on the sensor settings array. The GYROSCOPE_FILTER_SETTINGS variable is a combination of a few different registers. Its 8 bits look
     * like this: [00000ABB] where the A bit represents if the hi-pass filter is enabled and BB bits represent which filters get used. The 
     * ACCELEROMETER_FILTER_SETTINGS variable is also a combination of a few different registers. Its 8 bits look like this: [00000ABC] where the A
     * bit represents if the anti-aliasing filter is set to custom or auto, the B bit represents if the LPF2 is on or off and the C bit represents which
     * filter(s) get utilized for the final output value. The MAGNETOMETER_ODR variable is a combination of both the ODR and whether or not FastODR mode is 
     * enabled. Its 8 bits look like this: [0000AAAB] where the AAA bits represents the ODR and B represents FastODR mode. Finally, the MAGNETOMETER_POWER_MODE
     * variable is a combination of a few registers. Its 8 bits
     * look like this [00AABBCC] where the AA bits represent the power mode for the X and Y axes, the BB bits represent the power mode for the Z axis, and the CC
     * bits represent whether the magnetometer is in continous, single, or off mode.
